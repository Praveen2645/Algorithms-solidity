## Problem
In the Tower of Hanoi problem, you have three pegs labeled A, B, and C. The goal is to move a stack of n disks from peg A to peg C, using peg B as an auxiliary peg. The rules are that you can only move one disk at a time, and you must never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

"n": The number of disks you want to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for.
"source": The index or identifier of the source peg (A).
"auxiliary": The index or identifier of the auxiliary peg (B).
"target": The index or identifier of the target peg (C).

## to run the code
towerOfHanoi(5, 1, 2, 3);
and do check the "logs" from the output
